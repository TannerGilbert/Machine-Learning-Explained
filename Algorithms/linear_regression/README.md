## What is Linear Regression?

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable(y) and one or more independent variables(X). In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Linear Regression is one of the most popular algorithms in Machine Learning. That’s due to its relative simplicity and well known properties.

The best fit line can be calculated in multiple different ways including Least Squares Regression and Gradient Descent. In this guide we'll focus on using gradient descent since this is the most commonly used technique in Machine Learning.

## Simple Linear Regression

Linear Regression is called simple if you are only working with one independent variable.

### Cost Function

We can measure the accuracy of our linear regression algorithm using the **mean squared error** (mse) cost function. MSE measures the average squared distance between the predicted output and the actual output (label).

### Optimiztation

To find the coefficients that minimize our error function we will use gradient descent. Gradient descent is a optimization algorithm which iteratively takes steps to the local minimum of the cost function.

To find the way towards the minimum we take the derivative of the error function in respect to our slope m and our y intercept b. Then we take a step in the negative direction of the derivative.

## Multivariate Linear Regression

Linear Regression is called multivariate if you are working with at least two independent variables. Each of the independent variables also called features gets multiplied with a weight which is learned by our linear regression algorithm.

Loss and optimizer are the same as for simple linear regression. The only difference is that the optimizer is now used for any weight (<img src="tex/4b4518f1b7f0fb1347fa21506ebafb19.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=18.32105549999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> to <img src="tex/c2a29561d89e139b3c7bffe51570c3ce.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=16.41940739999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>) instead of only for m and b.

## Regularization

Regularization are techniques used to reduce overfitting. This is really important to create models that generalize well on new data.

Mathematically speaking, it adds a regularization term in order to prevent the coefficients to fit so perfectly to overfit. For Linear Regression we can decide between two techniques – L1 and L2 Regularization.

For more information on the difference between L1 and L2 Regularization check out the following article:

* http://www.chioka.in/differences-between-l1-and-l2-as-loss-function-and-regularization/

You can add regularization to Linear Regression by adding regularization term to either the loss function or to the weight update.
